- There are 4 peaks in the distribution of item MRP

## Model

The final model is a Random forest regressor.

The model has an rÂ² value of 0.602 and an Mean Average Error of $729.091 for 2131 items.

Hence the model will be able to predict sales with an eror of less than $1

## Recommendations:

There is significant correlation between Item Maximum retail price and sales, consider raising Maximum retail price in order to realise higher sales.

## Limitations & Next Steps
Even though raising maximum retail price could sales,it may also have a negative impact sales volumes, further investigation needs to be carried out to assess the full impact of retail prices of sales.
